Useful Utilities
========================
Useful Utilities is essentially a toolbox of iOS functions and code that can be pulled in as needed for functions that 
you repeatedly find yourself doing in your code. The design is such that there are no dependencies between files so that 
they can be kept lightweight and to avoid the "kitchen sink" syndrome that happens to most libraries.
The code is released with no strings attached. You don't even have to give me credit. Just enjoy using them. I use them
almost every day and literally on every project I work on. Feel free to shoot me quesitons, thanks, complaints or suggestions.
I love hearing from people.
